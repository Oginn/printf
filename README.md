# 0x11 C - printf

## Description
This team project is part of the first collaboration of ALX Software Engineering programme. 
	_printf replicates the C standard library printf() function.

What you should learn from this project:
* How to use git in a team setting
* Applying variadic functions to a big project
* The complexities of printf
* Managing a lot of files and finding a good workflow

## Mandatory Tasks
- [x] Write function that produces output with format 
   * Prototype: int ```_printf(const char *format, ...);```
- [x] Handle conversion specifiers  ```c```, ```s```, and ```%```,```d```, ```i```.
## Advanced Tasks
- [x] Handle conversion specifier ```b```: the unsigned int argument is converted to binary
- [x] Handle conversion specifiers ```u```, ```o```, ```x```, ```X```.
- [x] Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call ```write``` as little as possible.
- [x] Handle conversion specifier ```S```.
- [x] Handle conversion specifier ```p```.
- [x] Handle flag characters ```+```, space, and ```#``` for non-custom conversion specifiers.
- [x] Handle length modifiers ```l``` and ```h``` for non-custom conversion specifiers.
- [x] Handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.
- [x] Handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.
- [x] Handle the ```0``` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
- [x] Handle the ```-``` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.
- [x] Handle the custom conversion specifier ```r``` that prints the reversed string.
- [x] Handle the custom conversion specifier ```R``` that prints the rot13'ed string.
- [x] All above options should work well together.
